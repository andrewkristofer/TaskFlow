## üöÄ Introduction

**TaskFlow** is a dynamic and intuitive web application designed to help users and teams manage their projects and workflows efficiently. Users can sign up, log in, create tasks, and move them seamlessly between columns like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." All changes are persisted in a database, providing a reliable single source of truth for your project's status.

This project demonstrates a complete understanding of full-stack development, from client-side interactions and state management to server-side logic, API design, and database management.
